# Known gaps

Everything unfinished, stubbed or deliberately deferred. Nothing here may be
described as done, and nothing in the README, the first-run tour or a milestone
summary may imply any of it exists.

Every entry names an **expiry**: the milestone that closes it, or "not planned".

## Deferred stretch goals (agreed at step 1, 2026-09-11)

These were in the original scope list and were cut before any code was written.
Each is either something Sublime Merge does not do well either, or something the
primary user does not use. Don't build them without asking.

| Gap | Why deferred | Expiry |
|---|---|---|
| Visual bisect (mark good/bad in the graph) | Rare workflow for this user; the graph work it needs is better spent on daily views | Not planned for v1 |
| Worktree switcher | Rare. Opening a worktree directly still works: it looks like a normal repo | Not planned for v1 |
| LFS awareness (pointer files, locks) | Writes go through the user's own `git`, so their LFS filters already work. Graft adds no LFS UI | Not planned for v1 |
| Sparse-checkout awareness | Rare for this user; correctness risk is high and the payoff is low | Not planned for v1 |
| Several repos open at once in tabs | A window-management feature, not a Git feature. One repo per process | Not planned for v1 |
| Submodule operations (update, sync, init) | Submodules **display** in the sidebar and can be opened; operating on them is deferred | Not planned for v1 |

## Platform

| Gap | Why | Expiry |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | Explicit non-goal for v1 (ADR-0005). No Windows CI, no Windows terminals in the manual checklist | Not planned for v1 |

## Scheduled interim states

These are *temporary*. Each one is a real gap between the milestone that creates
it and the milestone that closes it, and each must be visible in the UI while it
exists.

| Gap | Created by | Expiry |
|---|---|---|
| **No in-app conflict resolver.** M5 can produce conflicts through merge, rebase and cherry-pick before M6 builds the three-pane resolver. M5 must detect the conflicted state, list the conflicting files, offer the user's configured `git mergetool` or `$EDITOR`, and keep the operation banner with Continue / Skip / Abort available. M5 must not claim conflict resolution works | M5 | **M6** |

*Builders and reviewers: add rows here the moment something is stubbed, naming
the milestone and ticket it came from. An entry here is not a failure; a missing
entry is (CLAUDE.md).*
